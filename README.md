# Comptable du coin

> This project is for an internship @ ASTROLOST
### First let's understand the concept of it all

I was asked to make a frontend application, design, logic, API connexion. 

For the developement of the template, as you would know if you ever checked my other projects, I use **UIKIT** and that is due to its compatibility with bootstrap which I decided not to use. 

UIkit gives a large hand of technical choices and it is easier to manipulate than other web ui frameworks.
